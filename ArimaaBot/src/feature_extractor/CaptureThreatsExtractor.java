	/* Excerpt from Wu on Capture Threats
	 * ----------------------------------
	 * Threatening and defending the capture of a piece plays a key role in many tactics.
	 *		THREATENS CAP(type,s,trap): Threatens capture of opposing piece of type type (0-7)
	 *			in s (1-4) steps , in trap trap (0-3). (128 features)
	 *		INVITES CAP MOVED(type,s,trap): Moves own piece of type type (0-7) so that it can be
	 *		 	captured by opponent in s (1-4) steps , in trap trap (0-3). (128 features)
	 *		INVITES CAP UNMOVED(type,s,trap): Own piece of type type (0-7) can now be captured by
	 *			opponent in s (1-4) steps, in trap trap (0-3), but it was not itself moved. 
	 *			(128 features)
	 *		PREVENTS CAP(type,loc): Removes the threat of capture from own piece of type type (0-7)
	 *			at location loc (0-31). (256 features)
	 *			
	 *	The way in which one defends the capture of a piece is also important.
	 *		CAP DEF ELE(trap,s): Defends own piece otherwise capturable in s (1-4) steps in trap 
	 *			trap (0-3) by using the elephant as a trap defender. (16 features)
	 *		CAP DEF OTHER(trap,s): Defends own piece otherwise capturable in s (1-4) steps in trap
	 *			trap (0-3) by using a non-elephant piece as a trap defender. (16 features)
	 *		CAP DEF RUNAWAY(trap,s): Defends own piece otherwise capturable in s (1-4) steps in trap
	 *			trap (0-3) by making the threatened piece run away. (16 features)
	 *		CAP DEF INTERFERE(trap,s): Defends own piece otherwise capturable in s (1-4) steps in trap
	 *			trap (0-3) by freezing or blocking the threatening piece. (16 features)
