	 * ------------------------------------
	 * Voluntarily stepping on a trap square can be dangerous when the trap has too few defenders.
	 * However, it can also be good to place a piece on a trap square because it allows that piece in
	 * the future to access any of the four surrounding squares for defending that trap, and a piece on
	 * a trap is hard to push away.
	 * 
	 * We heuristically define a "safe" trap for a player as one that is guarded either by two defenders
	 * of that player, or the elephant. Otherwise, the trap is "unsafe."
	 * 
	 * 		UNSAFE STEP ON TRAP(trap,type): Piece of type type (0-7) stepped on unsafe trap
	 * 			trap (0-3). (32 features)
	 * 		SAFE STEP ON TRAP(trap,type): Piece of type type (0-7) stepped on safe trap
	 * 			trap (0-3). (32 features)
